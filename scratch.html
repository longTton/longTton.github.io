        <h1>Totoro Nightmare</h1>
         <h3>
        Totoro is the title character in the Japanese animated film by Studio Ghibli – My Neighbor Totoro. 
        He’s a fuzzy, giant, furry, pointy-eared creature with wide eyes and a fantastic smile. In this game,
        totoro is trapped inside a box and controlled by an evil spirit and trying to kill you! There are three
        bosses: mini totoro, medium totoro and totoro, and the challenge of this game is to dodge every single
        projectile the boss shoots at you, as a cat bus, until he gets out of energy and fades away! GLHF~</h3>

                Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game?
                <br>
                The programming concept was making the sprite about to move left and right by pressing the left and right
                arrow. Also, the sprite can double jump to dodge incoming projectile. These are the things that I have learn
                to do in this project which I can able to make any sprite to move left, right, or jump at any key.

                Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?<br>
                Our group did encounter problems with the project which set up the incoming projectile that the player have to dodge. I solve
                this by making a value of time which the longer the player survive the more projectile that the player have to dodge.

                What aspects of your game do you like best?<br>
                I like how the sprite move smoothly and easy to move without problem.
            </li>
            <li>
                If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?<br>
                If I have more time for the project, I would like to change the theme of the game which is very out of 
                the place. The pacing of the game is very strange which I want to fix or experience the game if I have more time.
